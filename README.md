# LCD_LTN097QL01

Enclosure for iPad3 LCD (Samsung LTN097QL01)


# Thrustmaster_Joystick

Replacement housing for the Thrustmaster USB joystick. Just the base, excluding the stick and throttle. Note that in order to remove the joystick from its original base, you'll have to cut the wires and re-solder them after pulling it appart. I re-used both the original stick and throttle with this enclosure.
